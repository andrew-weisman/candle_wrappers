# candle_wrappers

This repository contains the files needed to set up CANDLE as a central installation (so that you can for example do `module load candle`) and will contain wrapper scripts around the CANDLE codebase that can be used for running the workflows.

Please see [README-biowulf.md](./README-biowulf.md) or [README-summit.md](./README-summit.md) for detailed instructions for these systems.
