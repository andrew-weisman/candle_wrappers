# Quick usage instructions on Summit

## Step (1): Load the CANDLE module

In lieu of `module load candle` being set up (Summit staff are working on setting up CANDLE as user-managed software), you can "load the `candle` module" for the time being via:

```bash
source /gpfs/alpine/med106/world-shared/candle/env_for_lmod-2020-11-11.sh
```
